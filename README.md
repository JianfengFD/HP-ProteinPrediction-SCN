# HPprotein-prediction-SCN
HPprotein-prediction-SCN is a package provides several python scripts of Deep Neural Network Models for 2D HP lattice protein fold prediction, based on Tensorflow 1.x. 

In this repository, we provide examples of **S**trong **C**orrelated **N**etwork(**SCN**) model and **Configuration Mapping** method to solve the protein folding prediction problems. The molecular chains here are 19mer theoretical proteins of two-dimensional lattice HP model. For comparision, we also provide several standard NN models on the same task to show the improvement brought by SCN and CM. 
> More Details are Shown in Paper(links)

In each python script, we realize the construction and training process of the neural network models. and also the evaluation of predicting accuracies, based on Tensorflow 1.x.
We provide a data making script to produce and partition training sets and data sets of HP 19mer chains. The repository [vvoelz/HPSandbox](https://github.com/vvoelz/HPSandbox) provides the raw data of HP proteins.
