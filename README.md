# HPprotein-NNprediction
Deep Neural Network Models for 2D HP lattice protein fold prediction, based on Tensorflow 1.x. 

In this repository, we provide several neural network modeling methods to solve the protein folding prediction task. The molecular chains here  are 19mer theoretical proteins of two-dimensional lattice HP model.

In each python script, we realized the construction and training of the NN models, and also the evaluation of predicting accuracies. 
We provide a data making script to produce and partition training sets and data sets of HP 19mer chains. The repository [vvoelz/HPSandbox](https://github.com/vvoelz/HPSandbox) provides the raw data of HP proteins.
